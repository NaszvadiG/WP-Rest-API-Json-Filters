# WP-Rest-API-Json-Filters

Extends the JSON response to a REST API V2 post requests, by 
- adding thumbnail image url and full image url to the JSON response
- adding authors avatar to a JSON response
- get the count of comments to a post

This is very useful when you build an Mobile app and use the WP REST API V2 to request data from the WP backend. It reduses the number of API call the mobile app is doing reducing the bandwith and speed up the delivery of a page to a mobile app.
